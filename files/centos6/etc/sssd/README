LINUX AD INTEGRATION
(This file is provided by Puppet)

The first time Puppet agent synchronizes with AD integration enabled
(auth_activedir = 'yes'), it is normal for the ff. services to fail:

- oddjobd
- sssd

To fix startup failures with oddjobd, reboot this computer.

In order for sssd to run, this computer needs to be added to the
AD domain first. Follow the steps below:

1.  Make sure NTPD is installed and running and is synchronized with the
    domain controller/s, and that all packages are updated in yum.

2.	Add the hostname and FQDN of the Linux client to /etc/hosts:

  127.0.0.1    thiscomputer.ad.domain.com thiscomputer ...(etc)

3.  /etc/resolv.conf should point to the domain controllers

4. Obtain Kerberos ticket and verify

  # kinit Administrator (or any AD user that has rights to join a workstation)
  # klist

5. Join to the domain and verify keytab

  # net ads join -k
  # klist -k

6. Obtain new Kerberos ticket via keytab

  # kinit -k THISCOMPUTER$
  # klist

7. Restart sssd

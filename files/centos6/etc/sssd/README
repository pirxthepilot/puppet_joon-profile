LINUX AD INTEGRATION
(This file is provided by Puppet)

The first time Puppet agent synchronizes with AD integration enabled
(auth_activedir = 'yes'), it is normal for the ff. services to fail:

- oddjobd
- sssd

To fix startup failures with oddjobd, reboot this computer.

In order for sssd to run, this computer needs to be added to the
AD domain first. Follow the steps below:

1.  It is recommended to pre-add the Linux AD client FQDN and hostname
    on both the domain Active Directory Computers and DNS.

2.  Make sure NTPD is installed and running and is synchronized with the
    domain controller/s, and that all packages are updated in yum.

3.	Run "hostname -f" and ensure that the hostname is the FQDN. If not,
    edit the localhost entry on the /etc/hosts file:

    127.0.0.1    thiscomputer.ad.domain.com thiscomputer ...(etc)

4.  /etc/resolv.conf should point to the domain controllers

5. Obtain Kerberos ticket and verify

  # kinit Administrator (or any AD user that has rights to join a workstation)
  # klist

6. Join to the domain and verify keytab

  # net ads join -k
  # klist -k

7. Obtain new Kerberos ticket via keytab

  # kinit -k THISCOMPUTER$
  # klist

8. Restart sssd

LINUX AD INTEGRATION
(This file is provided by Puppet)

The first time Puppet agent synchronizes with AD integration enabled
(auth_activedir = 'yes'), it is normal for the sssd service to fail.

In order for sssd to run, this computer needs to be added to the
AD domain first. Follow the steps below:


1.  It is recommended to pre-add the Linux AD client FQDN to DNS.

2.  Make sure NTPD is installed and running and is synchronized with the
    domain controller/s, and that all packages are updated in yum.

3.	Run "hostname -f" and ensure that the hostname is the FQDN. If not,
    edit the localhost entry on the /etc/hosts file:

    127.0.0.1    thiscomputer.ad.domain.com thiscomputer ...(etc)

4.  /etc/resolv.conf should point to the domain controllers

5. Obtain Kerberos ticket, join to AD, restart sssd

  # kinit Administrator (or any AD user that has rights to join a workstation)
  # net ads join -k
  # kinit -k THISCOMPUTER$
  # service sssd restart
